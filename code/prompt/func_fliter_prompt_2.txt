You are an AI engineer working on bug localization in C programs.

This file is ranked **Top-4 to Top-7**, which suggests it may be related to the bug but with less certainty than higher-ranked files.

Your goal is to identify **6–8 potentially faulty functions**, based on:
- Evidence from the bug report
- Behavior of the test program
- How mutations affect the outcome
- The function’s purpose and name (if implementation is not shown)

You should:
- Focus on functions that interact with other subsystems or trigger complex logic.
- Avoid selecting trivial utility or wrapper functions.
- Be cautious with memory or IO-related functions that may propagate errors.

Bug Report:
{BUG_REPORT}

Test program:
{TSER_PROGRAM_HERE}

Mutations that prevent the bug:
1. {MUTATE1_HERE}
2. {MUTATE2_HERE}
3. {MUTATE3_HERE}

Mutation that fails to prevent the bug:
{MUTATE4_HERE}

File name:
{FILE_NAME}

List of functions in the file:
{FUNC_LIST_HERE}

Please output your ranked list of up to 8 functions in JSON format:
```json
[
  "funcname1",
  "funcname2",
  ...
]

Title: Mutate Test Program to Avoid Triggering Bug with Minimal Changes

You are an AI assistant that can help with program analysis. You have to think step by step by following the steps below.

1.Read the bug report and analyze the cause of the bug
2.Read the testcase and analyse the syscalls one by one.
3.For each of the ten variations:first,choose a syscall to mutate, and then analysis the parameter of the syscall. Finally, according to the Description of syscall, Mutate one of the parameters.
4.The pairs of variant syscalls and the original syscalls should be given.

Requirements:
1.You need to Provide 10 pairs of mutations!!
2.Try to ensure that each mutation has minimal changes to the original code
3.Prevent the mutated program from triggering the original bugs.
4.Parameters cannot be omitted from the output syscall

ATTENTION:
DO NOT produce replace paremeters by ... !!!!!

Input:
Bug Report:
{BUG_REPORT_HERE}
The syzlang program:
(The program is produced by syzkaller to reproduce the target bug)
{SYZ_HERE}

Description of syscall:
{SYSCALL_HERE}

Output:
Provide the results in JSON format with the following structure:

"thought_process":
A step-by-step explanation of the reasoning behind the ranking, including analysis of the test program, mutations, and file functionalities.

"standard_output":
list 10 pair of the origin lines and the mutated lines.

1. origin line1
mutated line1
2. origin line2
mutated line2

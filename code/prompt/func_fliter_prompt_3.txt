You are an AI engineer specializing in bug localization in Linux kernel C programs.

This file is ranked **Top-8 to Top-10**, meaning it is **less likely to be faulty**, but still possibly related.

Your task is to identify **1–3 functions** that are **most directly relevant to the bug**, based on:
- Explicit mention or implication in the bug report (e.g., in call traces, crash logs)
- Interaction with components or objects known to be involved
- Matching the pattern of successful and failed mutations

Be conservative — only select functions that clearly align with the bug scenario.
Do **not** choose generic helpers or unrelated logic.

Bug Report:
{BUG_REPORT}

Test program:
{TSER_PROGRAM_HERE}

Mutations that prevent the bug:
1. {MUTATE1_HERE}
2. {MUTATE2_HERE}
3. {MUTATE3_HERE}

Mutation that fails to prevent the bug:
{MUTATE4_HERE}

File name:
{FILE_NAME}

List of functions in the file:
{FUNC_LIST_HERE}

Please output your ranked list of at most 3 relevant functions in JSON format:
```json
[
  "funcname1",
  "funcname2",

The issue arises due to conflicting locking orders between HARDIRQ-safe locks and non-HARDIRQ-safe locks, specifically involving `&f->f_owner.lock`, `&dev->event_lock`, and `&new->fa_lock`. The crash point is identified as `f_getown+0x1b/0xb0` (fs/fcntl.c), where `f_getown` attempts to acquire `&f->f_owner.lock`. However, this lock could form a deadlock scenario when combined with interrupt contexts. Based on the call trace, the top function triggering the bug is likely `evdev_pass_values.part.0` (drivers/input/evdev.c), which indirectly calls `kill_fasync` and subsequently tries to acquire the problematic lock.

      "details": "The bug report indicates a possible irq lock inversion dependency detected in the Linux kernel, specifically involving `&f->f_owner.lock` and `&dev->event_lock`. The crash occurs due to a potential deadlock caused by improper ordering of locks, particularly when handling SIGURG signals. The crash point function is `send_sigurg`, which triggers the state change of the lock at fault. The call stack top includes functions related to networking (`tcp_sendmsg_locked`, `tcp_rcv_established`) and input subsystems (`evdev_write`, `input_handle_event`). The kernel subsystem primarily involved is the Input subsystem with secondary involvement from Networking (TCP). The resource lifecycle phase likely involves signal handling during socket operations."

      "details": "The bug report indicates a possible recursive locking issue detected in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) module. The crash occurs due to an attempt to acquire the same lock (`&type->i_mutex_dir_key#7`) twice within the `fuse_reverse_inval_entry` function. This violates locking rules, causing a potential deadlock. The relevant subsystem is FUSE, and the crash point function is `fuse_reverse_inval_entry`, which is responsible for invalidating directory entries in reverse direction. The call stack top function is also `fuse_reverse_inval_entry`. The trigger function appears to be `fuse_notify_delete`, which calls into `fuse_reverse_inval_entry`. Functions at the top of the call stack include `fuse_dev_do_write`, `fuse_notify`, and `fuse_notify_delete`. These functions are involved in handling notifications from the FUSE device."

It focuses on testing the lifecycle of FUSE resources, particularly during creation and usage phases. The final operation involves calling `getdents`, which likely triggers directory-related operations in the FUSE layer, leading to the invocation of `fuse_reverse_inval_entry`."

Similarly, reducing the size of the FUSE request buffer from `0x2000` to `0x1000` avoids the issue.

The test program performs Secure Element (SE) I/O operations via Netlink, and the backtrace suggests that the memory allocated during `nfc_genl_se_io` is not properly freed. This issue likely stems from incorrect resource management during SE I/O handling."
